The best RL greatly outperformed both A* search and Breadth First Search in Mean score
per second. Though, while it did play faster, it got a much lower overall score. In the game
of snake it will naturally take longer for the player to get the apple as their score increases,
because their tail gets longer and will be in the way more often. Also, if I included the
training time alongside the RL, the time would be much higher, as it takes close to 10 minutes
for my computer to train 10000 times.  With this in mind, due to the drastic difference in 
score, which is ultimately the goal in snake (to get the highest score), I give the prize to 
A* search.
